# Pixelite
A Commodore 64 pixel editor made in HTML/JS

Thanks for JackAsser for the idea ;)

Currently just a very early proof of concept. Still a lot to do:

- grid
- color clash handling
- undo
- different graphics modes
- import/export
- brushes
- only tested on Chrome yet

## Help

- Move main canvas with cursor buttons
- Mouseweel on canvas: zoom in/out
- Drag any window to move
- Click on preview window to activate
- Zoom in/out activated preview with mousewheel
- Save with right click > Save As...
